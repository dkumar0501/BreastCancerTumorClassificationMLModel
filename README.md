## 📘 Overview

This project presents an **AI-based breast cancer tumor classification model** utilizing **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** trained on **ultrasound imaging data**.  
It aims to support **early breast cancer detection** by classifying tumors as **malignant**, **benign**, or **normal** using deep learning and image analysis techniques.  
The system achieved **over 92% classification accuracy** on a dataset of **1,000+ ultrasound images**.

## 🚀 Features

- Automated **tumor classification** from ultrasound scans  
- **CNN-based deep learning architecture** with transfer learning  
- **Data preprocessing** and **augmentation** for model generalization  
- **Performance optimization** with tuned hyperparameters  
- **Visualization** of model accuracy and loss metrics during training  

## 🧠 Technical Overview

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Programming Language** | Python |
| **Frameworks & Libraries** | TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib |
| **Dataset** | 1,000+ ultrasound images (malignant, benign, normal) |
| **Model Type** | Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) |
| **Optimization** | Learning rate tuning, batch normalization, dropout layers |
| **Accuracy** | 92% overall classification performance |

## 🧩 Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Standardizes image resolution and removes noise  
2. **Augmentation:** Enhances dataset using rotation, flipping, and scaling  
3. **Model Training:** CNN learns key image features for tumor detection  
4. **Evaluation:** Model validated using test data and confusion matrix  
5. **Interpretation:** Predictions cross-verified with clinical insights
