# Breast Cancer Tumor Classification ML Model
## Overview

This project develops a Breast Cancer Tumor Classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model classifies breast tumors as malignant, benign, or normal based on ultrasound images, achieving 92% accuracy. It utilizes over 700 ultrasound images and includes data preprocessing, augmentation, and model optimization.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Matplotlib, NumPy
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## Key Features

- **Accuracy:** 92% in classifying breast tumors.
- **Model:** CNN architecture with optimized hyperparameters.
- **Dataset:** 700+ ultrasound images.
- **Techniques:** Data preprocessing, augmentation, and model fine-tuning.

## How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Standardizes image size and enhances features.
