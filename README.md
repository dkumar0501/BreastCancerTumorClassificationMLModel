# Breast Cancer Classification

## Project Overview

This project involves the classification of breast cancer diagnoses using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify tumors as malignant or benign based on various features.

## Features

- **Dataset**: Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD)
- **Features**: Includes attributes like radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, and others.
- **Target**: Malignant or Benign

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**:
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
  - **NumPy**: For numerical operations
  - **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms
  - **Matplotlib**: For data visualization
  - **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization
  - **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and documentation

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies. You can do this by running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breast-cancer-classification.git
cd breast-cancer-classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Run `preprocessing.py` to clean and prepare the dataset.
2. **Model Training**: Execute `train_model.py` to train the machine learning model.
3. **Evaluation**: Use `evaluate_model.py` to evaluate the performance of the trained model.

Example command to train the model:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

## Results

- **Model Accuracy**: [Provide the accuracy or performance metrics]
- **Confusion Matrix**: [Include example results if possible]
